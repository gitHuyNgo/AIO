# Day 01 – Skills for AIO 2025

**Date:** 2025-06-03  
**Topic:** Overview of research workflow, reading papers, using Colab/ChatGPT, and solving equations

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 1. How to Find Documents and Papers
- Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Springer, arXiv, bioRxiv
- Specialized sites: PapersWithCode, Facebook group (AIO Q&A)
- Preprint repositories: arXiv for CS, bioRxiv for life sciences

### 2. How to Read Research Papers
- Difference between research papers vs essays
- Suggested reading order:
  1. Title
  2. Abstract
  3. Introduction
  4. Proposed Method
  5. Experimental Results
  6. Related Works
- Tools: NotebookLM for summarization

### 3. Where to Implement Code
- Jupyter Notebook (local, Anaconda)
- Google Colab (direct, from Drive, upload, mount drive)
- Best practices for saving/reopening notebooks

### 4. Using ChatGPT and Colab as Coding Assistants
- Prompt examples for:
  - For loops
  - Matplotlib plotting
  - Debugging and adding comments
  - Explaining existing code
  - Generating pseudocode
- Prompting for theory explanation (e.g., lambda function)

### 5. Documenting Results with Overleaf
- LaTeX essentials: \section, \subsection, \textbf, \itemize, \includegraphics, \href
- Writing math: `$...$` inline, `$$...$$` block
- Tables, lists, page breaks

### 6. Problem Solving: Quadratic Equation (x² + 3x - 4 = 0)
- Step-by-step solving using delta method
- if / if-else / if-elif-else logic in Python
- User-defined functions:
  - Naming convention
  - Parameters, return values
  - Docstring formatting
- Example: `solve_quadratic(a, b, c)`

### 7. ReLU Activation Function
- ReLU(x) = 0 if x ≤ 0; x otherwise

## 🔍 Personal Reflection

> _(Write your own struggles, realizations, or questions here)_  
> e.g. "I realized how important it is to structure prompts properly for ChatGPT when debugging."  
> e.g. "Still not fully confident with reading research papers, might need to try NotebookLM soon."
