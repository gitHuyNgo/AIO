# 🚀 AIO 2025: My AI & Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my public repository documenting everything I learn while studying AI and Data Science in 2025. This journey is designed to help me grow as a practitioner and connect with others on a similar path.

> 📌 I’m following a structured curriculum called **AIO 2025**, which spans 12 detailed modules — from Python foundations to Machine Learning and NLP.

## ✨ Why I’m Doing This

- To **learn deeply**, not just passively consume content
- To **build a strong portfolio** for internships and job applications
- To **stay consistent** by publicly tracking progress
- To **connect** with other learners and share knowledge
